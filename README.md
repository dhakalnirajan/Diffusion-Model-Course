## About Huggingface and this course:
  Huggingface is an AI community on a mission to democratize machine learning models. They open-source AI by providing a one-stop-shop of resources, ranging from models (+30k), datasets (+5k), ML demos (+2k) and libraries. You can deploy your model to open-source it on huggingface, or you can release Dataset you have prepared.

  This course aims to teach the impact of Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) and understand how they work on very basic level.This course was launched by <a href = "https://huggingface.co">Huggingface</a> and <a href = "https://linkedin.com/in/lewis-tunstall"> Lewis Tunstall </a>. The course is absolutely free. The course will consist of at least 4 Units. More will be added as time goes on, on topics like diffusion for audio.

Each unit consists of some theory and background alongside one or more hands-on notebooks. Some units will also contain suggested projects and we'll have competitions and swag for the best pipelines and demos (more details TDB).
